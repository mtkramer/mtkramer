    <h1>Mike Kramer | Software Developer</h1>
    <h4>also a Chemist, Electrician, Cook, Proof Supervisor and Adjuster in past lives</h4>
    <p>
      I'm a (mostly) self-taught coder with years of practice. I'm sure I could be an outstanding addition to any team.
      Allow me to work with your team and you will be surprised by my genuine imagination, potential, and drive to
      excel. Full stack web development, data science and statistics, machine learning, AI, botting, gaming, and AR/VR,
      are all computing interests of mine. I also come pre-programmed with a wide variety of master-level domain
      knowledge which could help my team to tailor software features to our clients' specific needs.
